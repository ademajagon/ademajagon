## Agon

I write software to solve problems or understand them better.

Most of the code here is experimental. Some of it is useful. All of it is written with intent.

## Principles

- No performance, no point.  
- Hard to read? Itâ€™s probably wrong.  
- Complexity must be eliminated.  
- No tests, no trust.  
- Meaningful names only.
